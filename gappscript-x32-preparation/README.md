# gappscript-x32-preparation

This Google App Script aims to enrich data from Planning Center Online to create a proposal for the design of the X32 mixer.

In addition, a standard X32 scene file and a template shall be linked with the above mentioned data to transfer the suggestion for the design of the mixer into an X32 scene file.

The script should also be able to compare the scene files from before and after the service and allow the user to mark changes as relevant so that updated presets can be saved. This gradually improves the sound for each individual instrument, but also the In Ear Mix for the musicians is becoming more and more reliable.

For the script the version control is done in the GitHub repository [saddleback-x32-general-scene](https://github.com/cabcookie/saddleback-x32-general-scene.git). It also contains the standard X32 scene file, the template for the scene file, as well as the presets for instruments, vocalists and in-ear monitors.
